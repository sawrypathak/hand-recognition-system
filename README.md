Control system volume using hand gestures via webcam with real-time fingertip tracking using OpenCV and AI.

# ✋ Hand Gesture Volume Control

Control your system volume using hand gestures captured via webcam. This project uses OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe or YOLOv8 (Python 3.12+) to detect the distance between your thumb and index finger, adjusting the system volume accordingly with pycaw.

## 🎥 Demo

Real-time volume control by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart.
